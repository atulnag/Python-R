    "* So far we have been reading through files, looking for patterns and extracting various bits of lines that we find interesting. We have been using string methods like `split` and `find` and using lists and string slicing to extract portions of the lines.\n",
    "* This task of searching and extracting is so common that Python has a very powerful library called *regular expressions* that handles many of these tasks quite elegantly.\n",
    "* we will only cover the basics of regular expressions. For more detail on regular expressions, see:\n",

    " * https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html\n",
    "* The regular expression library `re` must be imported into your program before you can use it. \n",
    "* The simplest use of the regular expression library is the `search()` function."
